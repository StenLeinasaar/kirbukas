# Kirbukas

The name references an estonian word that most closely resembles yard sale. The idea is quite straightforward. I want to get stuff as cheap as possible so my financials can grow.
So, that's exactly what I am doing. I am slowly and steadily building a generic budgeting app for myself. 


## Current In-progress work

- [X] - Create .NET backend barebone structure. 
- [ ] - Update the database context and plan out a proper database design for the financials. Requires knowing how I should divide my expenses into categories.
- [ ] - Choose front-end technology to use. It can currently be anything.
- [ ] - Look into options to host it for free. Perhaps even from your old computer via apache.
- [ ] - Or create a mobile app and use firestore as a database service.


Thank you for checking out my project. I am currently super busy with work related things, but I am going to come back here.
